### Contributors

* See the overall GitHub contributors [here](https://github.com/NAG-DevOps/speed-hpc/graphs/contributors)
* [Dr. Serguei A. Mokhov](https://github.com/smokhov) -- project lead
* Current HPC/Research support team: [Gillian A. Roper](https://github.com/yulgroper), [Carlos Alarcon Meza](https://github.com/carlos-encs), [Farah Salhany](https://github.com/salhanyf)
* [Dr. Tariq Daradkeh](https://github.com/tariqghd) helped us with continuous support of Speed and its users and working on scheduling prediction. He has also integrated the OpenISS YOLOv3 example

\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:introduction}

This document contains basic information required to use ``Speed'', along with tips,
tricks, examples, and references to projects and papers that have used Speed.
User contributions of sample jobs and/or references are welcome.

\noindent \textbf{Note:}
On October 20, 2023, we completed the migration to SLURM from Grid Engine (UGE/AGE) as our job scheduler.
This manual has been updated to use SLURM's syntax and commands.
If you are a long-time GE user, refer to \xa{appdx:uge-to-slurm} for key highlights needed to
translate your GE jobs to SLURM as well as environment changes.
These changes are also elaborated throughout this document and our examples.

% What Speed Is Ideal For
% -------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{What Speed Is Ideal For}
\label{sect:speed-is-for}

\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Design, develop, test, and run parallel, batch, and other algorithms and scripts with partial data sets.
	``Speed'' has been optimized for compute jobs that are multi-core aware,
	require a large memory space, or are iteration intensive.

	\item
	Prepare jobs for large clusters such as:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Digital Research Alliance of Canada (Calcul Quebec and Compute Canada)
			\item Cloud platforms
		\end{itemize}
	\item
	Jobs that are too demanding for a desktop.
	\item
	Single-core batch jobs; multithreaded jobs typically up to 32 cores (i.e., a single machine).
	\item
	Multi-node multi-core jobs (MPI).
	\item
	Anything that can fit into a 500-GB memory space and a \textbf{speed scratch} space of approximately 10~TB. 
	\item
	CPU-based jobs.
	\item
	CUDA GPU jobs.
	\item
	Non-CUDA GPU jobs using OpenCL.
\end{itemize}

% What Speed Is Not
% -------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{What Speed Is Not}
\label{sect:speed-is-not}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Speed is not a web host and does not host websites.
	\item Speed is not meant for Continuous Integration (CI) automation deployments for Ansible or similar tools.
	\item Does not run Kubernetes or other container orchestration software.
	\item Does not run Docker. (\textbf{Note:} Speed does run Singularity and many Docker containers can be converted to
	Singularity containers with a single command. See \xs{sect:singularity-containers}.)
	\item Speed is not for jobs executed outside of the scheduler. (Jobs running outside of the scheduler will be killed and all data lost.)
\end{itemize}

% Available Software
% -------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Available Software}
\label{sect:available-software}

There are a wide range of open-source and commercial software available and installed on ``Speed.''
This includes Abaqus~\cite{abaqus}, AllenNLP, Anaconda, ANSYS, Bazel,
COMSOL, CPLEX, CUDA, Eclipse, Fluent~\cite{fluent}, Gurobi, MATLAB~\cite{matlab,scholarpedia-matlab},
OMNeT++, OpenCV, OpenFOAM, OpenMPI, OpenPMIx, ParaView, PyTorch, QEMU, R, Rust, and Singularity among others.
Programming environments include various versions of Python, C++/Java compilers, TensorFlow, OpenGL, OpenISS, and {\marf}~\cite{marf}.

In particular, there are over 2200 programs available in \texttt{/encs/bin} and \texttt{/encs/pkg} under Scientific Linux 7 (EL7).
We are building an equivalent array of programs for the EL9 SPEED2 nodes. To see the packages available, run \texttt{ls -al /encs/pkg/} on \texttt{speed.encs}.
See a complete list in \xa{sect:software-list}.

\noindent\textbf{Note:} We do our best to accommodate custom software requests.
Python environments can use user-custom installs from within scratch directory.

% Requesting Access
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Requesting Access}
\label{sect:access-requests}

After reviewing the ``What Speed is'' (\xs{sect:speed-is-for}) and
``What Speed is Not'' (\xs{sect:speed-is-not}), request access to the ``Speed''
cluster by emailing: \texttt{rt-ex-hpc AT encs.concordia.ca}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item GCS ENCS faculty and staff may request access directly.
	\item GCS students must include the following in their request message:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item GCS ENCS username
		\item Name and email (CC) of the approver -- either a supervisor, course instructor,
		or a department representative (e.g., in the case of undergraduate or M.Eng.\ students it
		can be the Chair, associate chair, a technical officer, or a department administrator) for approval.
		\item Written request from the approver for the GCS ENCS username to be granted access to ``Speed.''
	\end{itemize}
	\item Non-GCS students taking a GCS course will have their GCS ENCS account created automatically, but still need the course instructor's approval to use the service.
	\item Non-GCS faculty and students need to get a ``sponsor'' within GCS, so that a guest GCS ENCS account is created first. A sponsor can be any GCS Faculty member
	you collaborate with. Failing that, request the approval from our Dean's Office;
	via our Associate Deans Drs.~Eddie Hoi Ng or Emad Shihab.
	\item External entities collaborating with GCS Concordia researchers should also go through the Dean's Office for approvals.
\end{itemize}

\href{https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/aits/speed.html}{Computing (HPC) Facility: Speed} webpage.

% Data Retention Policy
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Data Retention Policy}
\label{sect:data-retention-policy}

Speed storage is intended for active research and teaching. Users are responsible for maintaining local copies of important data. The following rules apply:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Scratch directories} (\texttt{/speed-scratch}) 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Files are subject to automatic cleanup if they have not been accessed (``touched'') in the past 90 days (see exceptions).
		\item Scratch data are also purged upon account expiry and deletion (see exceptions).
		\item Exceptions: content placed under approved group subfolders (e.g., \texttt{/a2}, \texttt{/gipsy}, \texttt{/nag}) is retained. In such cases, files are reassigned to the group owner and associated group.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Temporary local storage} (\texttt{/nobackup} on all nodes and \texttt{/nobackup2} on SPEED2 nodes) is cleaned on node reboots or after 90 days of inactivity.
	
	\item \textbf{Research subcluster storage} (\texttt{/nobackups2} on Salus, OpsRes, CISR, Nebular) is not affected by the 90-day cleanup, but it is not backed up. Users must maintain local copies of their important data.
    
	\item \textbf{Home directories, \texttt{/private}, and \texttt{/group} directories} are not subject to scratch cleanup. These areas are protected by snapshots (see ENCS Data Storage documentation \url{https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/aits/support/faq/snapshot.html}).

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{What Speed Comprises}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Twenty four (24) 32-core compute nodes, each with 512 GB of memory and approximately 1 TB of volatile-scratch disk space. 
\item
Twelve (12) NVIDIA Tesla P6 GPUs, with 16 GB of memory (compatible with the CUDA, OpenGL, OpenCL, and Vulkan APIs). 
\item
One AMD FirePro S7150 GPUs, with 8 GB of memory (compatible with the Direct X, OpenGL, OpenCL, and Vulkan APIs). 
\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{What Speed Is Ideal For}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Jobs that are too demanding for a desktop, but that are not worth the hassles associated with the provincial and national clusters. 
\item
Single-core batch jobs; multithreaded jobs up to 32 cores (i.e., a single machine).
\item
Anything that can fit into a 500-GB memory space and a scratch space of approximately 1 TB. 
\item
CPU-based jobs. 
\item
CUDA GPU jobs (\texttt{speed-05}, \texttt{speed-17}).
\item
Non-CUDA GPU jobs using OpenCL (\texttt{speed-19} and \texttt{speed-05|17}).
\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Speed's Intent}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 
To Design and Develop, test and run parallel, batch, etc. algorithms, scripts with partial data sets.
	\item 
Prepare them for big clusters:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
Calcul Quebec
	\item 
Compute Canada
	\item 
Cloud platforms
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Available Software}

We have a great number of open-source software available and installed
on Speed -- various Python, CUDA versions, {\cpp}/{\java} compilers, OpenGL,
OpenFOAM, OpenCV, TensorFlow, OpenMPI, OpenISS, {\marf}~\cite{marf}, etc.
There are also a number of commercial packages, subject to licensing
contributions, available, such as MATLAB~\cite{matlab,scholarpedia-matlab}, Abaqus~\cite{abaqus}, 
Ansys, Fluent~\cite{fluent}, etc. 


To see the packages available, run \texttt{ls -al /encs/pkg/} on \texttt{speed.encs}.


In particular, there are over 2200 programs available in
\texttt{/encs/bin} and \texttt{/encs/pkg} under Scientific Linux 7 (EL7).

\begin{itemize}
	\item 
Popular concrete examples:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
MATLAB (R2016b, R2018a, R2018b)
	\item 
Fluent (19.2)
	\item 
Singularity (Docker-like container), can run other OS's apps, like Ubuntu's.
\end{itemize}
	\item 
We do our best to accommodate custom software requests.
Python environments can be used to have user-custom installs
in the scratch directory.
	\item 
A number of specific environments are available, too.
	\item 
Popular examples mentioned (loaded with, \tool{module}):
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
Python (2.3.0 - 3.5.1)
	\item 
Gurobi (7.0.1, 7.5.0, 8.0.0, 8.1.0)
	\item 
Ansys (16, 17, 18, 19)
	\item 
OpenFOAM (2.3.1, 3.0.1, 5.0, 6.0)
	\item 
Cplex 12.6.x to 12.8.x
	\item

\section{Job Management}
\label{sect:job-management}

In these instructions, anything bracketed like so, \verb+<>+, indicates a
label/value to be replaced (the entire bracketed term needs replacement).

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Requesting Access}
The first step to using the ``Speed'' cluster is to request access. 

Please email your access request to, \texttt{rt-ex-hpc AT encs.concordia.ca}, 
including your ENCS account's username.

If you are a student, please include the name of your Supervisor or instructor
as well as a statement from that person which indicates that you may have
access to ``Speed''.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Getting Started}

Once your ENCS account has been granted access to ``Speed'',
use your ENCS account credentials to create an SSH connection to 
\texttt{speed} (an alias for \texttt{speed-submit.encs.concordia.ca}). 

\subsubsection{SSH Connections}
If you are connecting from home, and have a Mac or Linux system, in a
terminal, this will connect you (on a single line):

\begin{verbatim}
ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh <ENCSusername>@login.encs.concordia.ca nc speed 22"
  <ENCSusername>@speed.encs.concordia.ca
\end{verbatim}

Windows users can create SSH connections via PuTTY (or MobaXterm). 

All users are expected to have a basic understanding of Linux and its 
commonly used commands.

\subsubsection{Environment Set Up}
\label{envsetup}
After creating an SSH session to ``Speed'', you will need to source the scheduler file:

\begin{verbatim}
source /local/pkg/uge-8.6.3/root/default/common/settings.csh 
\end{verbatim}

If sourcing the settings file has been successful, you will now have access to 
the scheduler commands. 
For example, if, \texttt{qstat -f -u "*"}, returns something non-error related, 
you are in business. 

The next step is to copy a job template to your home directory and to set up your
cluster-specific storage. Execute the following command from within your
home directory. (To move to your home directory, type \texttt{cd} at the Linux
prompt and press \texttt{Enter}.) 

\begin{verbatim}
cp /home/n/nul-uge/template.sh . && mkdir /speed-scratch/$USER
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Tip:} Add the source command to your shell-startup environment. 

For \textbf{new ENCS Users}, and/ or those who don't have an \file{.tcshrc} 
file, move a copy of the \file{.tcshrc} in \texttt{nul-uge}'s. home directory 
to your home directory with:

\begin{verbatim}
cp /home/n/nul-uge/.tcshrc . 
\end{verbatim}

Users who already have an \file{.tcshrc} file, use a text editor, such as
 \tool{vim} or \tool{emacs}, to add the source request to your existing
shell-startup environment (i.e., to the \file{.tcshrc} file in your home directory). 

Note that you will need to either log out and back in, or execute a new shell, 
for the environment changes in the updated \file{.tcshrc} file to be applied 
(important). 

If you use \tool{bash}, or another shell, please contact 
\texttt{rt-ex-hpc AT encs.concordia.ca}.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Job Submission Basics}

Preparing your job for submission is fairly straightforward. Editing a copy
of the\file{template.sh} you moved into your home directory during section
\refname{envsetup} is a good place to start. You can also use a job script
example from our GitHub's (\url{https://github.com/NAG-DevOps/speed-hpc}) ''src'' 
directory and base your job on it.

Job scripts are broken into four main sections: 
\subsubsection{The shell call}

The first section is the shell call, and that can be left as is, unless 
you want to use a different shell. It is recommened to call the version 
of the shell in \texttt{/encs/bin}. 

For example, to use \texttt{tcsh} use the following shell call:

\begin{verbatim}
#!/encs/bin/tcsh
\end{verbatim}

For \texttt{bash} use the following shell call:
\begin{verbatim}
#!/encs/bin/bash
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Job Scheduler Options}
The next section contains the options provided to the cluster scheduler 
and \file{template.sh} provides the essentials:

\begin{verbatim}
#$ -N <jobname>
#$ -cwd
#$ -m bea
#$ -pe smp <corecount>
#$ -l h_vmem=<memory>G
\end{verbatim}

Replace, \verb+<jobname>+, with the name that you want your cluster job to have;
\option{-cwd}, makes the current working directory the ``job working directory'',
and your standard output file will appear here; \option{-m bea}, provides e-mail
notifications (begin/end/abort); replace, \verb+<corecount>+, with the degree of
(multithreaded) parallelism (i.e., cores) you attach to your job (up to
32), and this line needs to be deleted or commented out if not relevant;
replace, \verb+<memory>+, with the value (in GB), that you want your job's memory
space to be (up to 500), and all jobs MUST have a memory-space assignment.

If you are unsure about memory footprints, err on assigning a generous
memory space to your job so that it does not get prematurely terminated
(the value given to \api{h\_vmem} is a hard memory ceiling). You can refine
\api{h\_vmem} values for future jobs by monitoring the size of a job's active
memory space on \texttt{speed-submit} with:

\begin{verbatim}
qstat -j <jobID> | grep maxvmem
\end{verbatim}

Memory-footprint values are also provided for completed jobs in the final
e-mail notification (as, ``Max vmem''), and via the accounting function on
\texttt{speed-submit} with:

\begin{verbatim}
qacct -j <jobID> | grep maxvmem
\end{verbatim}

Jobs that request a low-memory footprint are more likely to load on a busy
cluster.

\subsubsection*{Module Loads}
The third job-script section is for module loads. On \texttt{speed-submit}, to list
available modules, execute the following at the command line:

\begin{verbatim}
module avail
\end{verbatim}

To list for a particular program (\tool{matlab}, for example):

\begin{verbatim}
module -t avail matlab
\end{verbatim}

Which, of course, can be shortened to match all that start with a
particular letter:

\begin{verbatim}
module -t avail o
\end{verbatim}

To load a module (here, again, using \tool{matlab}):

\begin{verbatim}
module load matlab/R2020a/default
\end{verbatim}

Use, \option{unload}, in place of, \option{load}, to remove a module from active use.

Finally, to list loaded modules:

\begin{verbatim}
module list
\end{verbatim}

Typically only the \texttt{module load} command will be used in your script.

\subsubsection*{Program Calls}
Lastly, what you want to execute in your job goes into the fourth section
of the script. A common execution framework comprises the program call,
and options to the program specifying location of input and output files,
as well as a declaration of degree of parallelism (note the
cluster-specific environment variable, \api{NSLOTS}, which resolves to the value
provided to the scheduler option, \option{-pe smp}), though, obviously, every
program has its own unique execution framework.

Please note that jobs that expect to touch data-input and data-output files
more than once should make use of \api{TMPDIR}, a scheduler-provided working
space (this is quite generous, close to ~1TB in size). \api{TMPDIR} is created
when a job starts, and exists on the local disk of the compute node
executing your job, so I/O operations are much faster than what would be
expected to/from the shared storage (which is provided over NFS). An
example job script using \api{TMPDIR} is found at
% TODO: update / sync with repo version, git pull repo in /home/n/nul-uge/
%       so they all refer to the same scripts.
\texttt{/home/n/nul-uge/templateTMPDIR.sh}: the job is instructed to change to
\api{\$TMPDIR}, to make the new directory \texttt{input}, to copy data from
\texttt{\$SGE\_O\_WORKDIR/references/} to \texttt{input/} (\texttt{\$SGE\_O\_WORKDIR} represents the
current working directory), to make the new directory \texttt{results}, to
execute the program (which takes input from \texttt{\$TMPDIR/input/} and writes
output to \texttt{\$TMPDIR/results/}), and finally to copy the total end results
to an existing directory, \texttt{processed}, that is located in the current
working directory. TMPDIR only exists for the duration of the job, though,
so it is very important to copy relevant results from it at job's end.

Now, let's look at a basic job script, \file{tcsh.sh} in \xf{fig:tcsh.sh}
(you can copy it from our GitHub page or from \texttt{/home/n/nul-uge}).

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \lstinputlisting[language=csh,frame=single,basicstyle=\ttfamily]{tcsh.sh}
    \caption{Source code for \file{tcsh.sh}}
	\label{fig:tcsh.sh}
\end{figure}

This script sleeps on a node for 30 seconds, uses the 
\tool{module} command to load the \texttt{gurobi/8.1.0} 
environment, and then prints the list of loaded modules 
into a file. Concentrating on the first 
four lines, the first line is the shell declaration; the next three 
lines are submission options passed to the scheduler. 
The first, \texttt{-N}, attaches a name to the job (otherwise it is 
called what the job script is called), the second, \texttt{-cwd},
tells the scheduler to execute the job from the current working 
directory, and not to use the default of your home directory (potentially 
important for output-file placement), and the third, \texttt{-l h\_vmem}, 
requests and assigns a 1GB of memory space to the job (this is an upper bound, and 
jobs that attempt to use more will be terminated). Note that this third 
option is \emph{not} optional (if you do not specify a memory space, 
submission of the job will fail). Also notice the syntax that denotes a 
scheduler option, the, \texttt{\#\$}.

The scheduler command, \tool{qsub}, is used to submit (non-interactive) jobs. 
To submit this job: \texttt{qsub ./tcsh.sh}. You will see, \texttt{"Your job 
X ("qsub-test") has been submitted"}. The command, \tool{qstat}, can be used 
to look at the status of the cluster: \texttt{qstat -f -u "*"}. You will see 
something like this:

\normalsize

Remember that you only have 30 seconds before the job is essentially over, so 
if you do not see a similar output, either adjust the sleep time in the 
script, or execute the \tool{qstat} statement more quickly. The \tool{qstat} 
output listed above shows you that your job is 
running on node \texttt{speed-05}, that it has a job number of 144, that it 
was started at 16:39:30 on 12/03/2018, and that it is a single-core job (the 
default). 

Once the job finishes, there will be a new file in the directory that the job 
was started from, with the syntax of, \texttt{"job name".o"job number"}, so 
in this example the file is, qsub \file{test.o144}. This file represents the 
standard output (and error, if there is any) of the job in question. If you 
look at the contents of your newly created file, you will see that it 
contains the output of the, \texttt{module list} command. 
Important information is often written to this file.

Congratulations on your first job!

\subsection{Common Job Management Commands Summary}
\label{sect:job-management-commands}

Here are useful job-management commands: 

\begin{itemize}
\item
\texttt{qsub ./<myscript>.sh}: once that your job script is ready,
on \texttt{speed-submit} you can submit it using this

\item
\texttt{qstat -f -u <ENCSusername>}: you can check the status of your job(s)

\item
\texttt{qstat -f -u "*"}: display cluster status for all users. 

\item
\texttt{qstat -j [job-ID]}: display job information for [job-ID] (said job may be actually running, or waiting in the queue). 

\item
\texttt{qdel [job-ID]}: delete job [job-ID]. 

\item
\texttt{qhold [job-ID]}: hold queued job, [job-ID], from running. 

\item
\texttt{qrls [job-ID]}: release held job [job-ID]. 

\item
\texttt{qacct -j [job-ID]}: get job stats. for completed job [job-ID]. \api{maxvmem} is one of the more useful stats. 
\end{itemize}


% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Advanced \tool{qsub} Options}
\label{sect:qsub-options}

In addition to the basic \tool{qsub} options presented earlier, there are a few additional options that are generally useful:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\texttt{-m bea}: requests that the scheduler e-mail you when a job (b)egins; (e)nds; (a)borts. Mail is sent to the default address of, \texttt{"username@encs.concordia.ca"}, unless a different address is supplied (see, \texttt{-M}). The report sent when a job ends includes job 
runtime, as well as the maximum memory value hit (\api{maxvmem}). 

\item
\texttt{-M email@domain.com}: requests that the scheduler use this e-mail notification address, rather than the default (see, \texttt{-m}). 

\item
\texttt{-v variable[=value]}: exports an environment variable that can be used by the script.

\item
\texttt{-l h\_rt=[hour]:[min]:[sec]}: sets a job runtime of HH:MM:SS. Note that if you give a single number, that represents \emph{seconds}, not hours. 

\item
\texttt{-hold\_jid [job-ID]}: run this job only when job [job-ID] finishes. Held jobs appear in the queue. 
The many \tool{qsub} options available are read with, \texttt{man qsub}. Also note that \tool{qsub} options can be specified during the job-submission command, and these \emph{override} existing script options (if present). The syntax is, \texttt{qsub [options] /PATHTOSCRIPT}, but unlike in the script, the options are specified without the leading \verb+#$+ (e.g., \texttt{qsub -N qsub-test -cwd -l h\_vmem=1G ./tcsh.sh}). 
\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Array Jobs}
Array jobs are those that start a batch job or a parallel job multiple times. Each iteration of the job array is called a task and receives a unique job ID.

To submit an array job, use the \texttt{\-t} option of the \texttt{qsub} command as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
qsub -t n[-m[:s]] <batch_script>
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{-t Option Syntax:}
\begin{itemize}
\item
\texttt{n}: indicates the start-id.
\item
\texttt{m}: indicates the max-id.
\item
\texttt{s}: indicates the step size.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item
\texttt{qsub -t 10 array.sh}: submits a job with 1 task where the task-id is 10. 
\item
\texttt{qsub -t 1-10 array.sh}: submits a job with 10 tasks numbered consecutively from 1 to 10.
\item
\texttt{qsub -t 3-15:3 array.sh}: submits a jobs with 5 tasks numbered consecutively with step size 3
(task-ids 3,6,9,12,15).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Output files for Array Jobs:}
The default and output and error-files are \option{job\_name.\[o\|e\]job\_id} and \option{job\_name.\[o\|e\]job\_id.task\_id}.

This means that Speed creates an output and an error-file for each task generated by the array-job as well as one
for the super-ordinate array-job. To alter this behavior use the \option{\-o} and \option{\-e} option of \option{qsub}. 

For more details about Array Job options, please review the manual pages for \option{qsub} by executing 
the following at the command line on speed-submit \option{man qsub}.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Requesting Multiple Cores (i.e., Multithreading Jobs)}

For jobs that can take advantage of multiple machine cores, up to 32 cores (
per job) can be requested in your script with: 

\begin{verbatim}
#$ -pe smp [#cores] 
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Do not request more cores than you think will be useful}, as larger-core
jobs are more difficult to schedule. On the flip side, though, if you 
are going to be running a program that scales out to the maximum single-machine
core count available, please (please) request 32 cores, to avoid node 
oversubscription (i.e., to avoid overloading the CPUs).

Core count associated with a job appears under, ``states'', in the,
\texttt{qstat -f -u "*"}, output.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Interactive Jobs}

Job sessions can be interactive, instead of batch (script) based. Such 
sessions can be useful for testing and optimising code and resource 
requirements prior to batch submission. To request an interactive job 
session, use, \texttt{qlogin [options]}, similarly to a 
\tool{qsub} command-line job (e.g., \texttt{qlogin -N qlogin-test -l h\_vmem=1G}).
Note that the options that are available for \tool{qsub} are not necessarily
available for \tool{qlogin}, notably, \texttt{-cwd}, and, \texttt{-v}. 

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Scheduler Environment Variables}

The scheduler presents a number of environment variables that can be used in 
your jobs. Three of the more useful are \api{TMPDIR}, \api{SGE\_O\_WORKDIR}, 
and \api{NSLOTS}:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\api{\$TMPDIR}=the path to the job's temporary space on the node. It \emph{only} exists for the duration of the job, so if data in the temporary space are important, they absolutely need to be accessed before the job terminates.

\item
\api{\$SGE\_O\_WORKDIR}=the path to the job's working directory (likely a NFS-mounted path). If, \texttt{-cwd}, was stipulated, that path is taken; if not, the path defaults to your home directory.

\item
\api{\$NSLOTS}=the number of cores requested for the job. This variable can be used in place of hardcoded thread-request declarations. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In \xf{fig:tmpdir.sh} is a sample script, using all three.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \lstinputlisting[language=csh,frame=single,basicstyle=\footnotesize\ttfamily]{tmpdir.sh}
    \caption{Source code for \file{tmpdir.sh}}
	\label{fig:tmpdir.sh}
\end{figure}


% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{SSH Keys For MPI}

Some programs effect their parallel processing via MPI (which is a 
communication protocol). An example of such software is Fluent. MPI needs to 
have `passwordless login' set up, which means SSH keys. In your NFS-mounted 
home directory:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\texttt{cd .ssh}
\item
\texttt{ssh-keygen -t ed25519} (default location; blank passphrase) 
\item
\texttt{cat id\_ed25519.pub >> authorized\_keys} (if the \file{authorized\_keys}
file already exists) \emph{OR} \texttt{cat id\_ed25519.pub > authorized\_keys} (if does not) 
\item
Set file permissions of \file{authorized\_keys} to 600; of your NFS-mounted home
to 700 (note that you likely will not have to do anything here, as most people
will have those permissions by default). 
\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Example Job Script: Fluent}

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \lstinputlisting[language=csh,frame=single,basicstyle=\footnotesize\ttfamily]{fluent.sh}
    \caption{Source code for \file{fluent.sh}}
	\label{fig:fluent.sh}
\end{figure}

The job script in \xf{fig:fluent.sh} runs Fluent in parallel over 32 cores. Of note, I have requested e-mail notifications (\texttt{-m}), am defining the parallel environment for, \tool{fluent}, with, \texttt{-sgepe smp} (very important), and am setting \api{\$TMPDIR} as the in-job location for the ``moment'' \file{rfile.out} file (in-job, because the last line of the script copies everything from \api{\$TMPDIR} to a directory in my NFS-mounted home). Job progress can be monitored by examining the standard-out file (e.g., \file{flu10000.o249}), and/or by examining the ``moment'' file in \file{/disk/nobackup/<yourjob>} (hint: it starts with your job-ID) on the node running the job. Caveat: take care with journal-file file paths.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Java Jobs}

Jobs that call \tool{java} have a memory overhead, which needs to be taken 
into account when assigning a value to \api{h\_vmem}. Even the most basic 
\tool{java} call, \texttt{java -Xmx1G -version}, will need to have,
\texttt{-l h\_vmem=5G}, with the 4-GB difference representing the memory overhead. 
Note that this memory overhead grows proportionally with the value of
\texttt{-Xmx}. To give you an idea, when \texttt{-Xmx} has a value of 100G,
\api{h\_vmem} has to be at least 106G; for 200G, at least 211G; for 300G, at least 314G.

% TODO: add a MARF Java job

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Scheduling On The GPU Nodes}

The cluster has two GPU nodes, each with six Tesla (CUDA-compatible) P6
cards: each card has 2048 cores and 16GB of RAM. Though note that the P6
is mainly a single-precision card, so unless you need the GPU double
precision, double-precision calculations will be faster on a CPU node.

Job scripts for the GPU queue differ in that they do not need these
statements:

\begin{verbatim}
#$ -pe smp <threadcount>
#$ -l h_vmem=<memory>G
\end{verbatim}

But do need this statement, which attaches either a single GPU, or, two
GPUs, to the job:

\begin{verbatim}
#$ -l gpu=[1|2]
\end{verbatim}

Single-GPU jobs are granted 5~CPU cores and 80GB of system memory, and
dual-GPU jobs are granted 10~CPU cores and 160GB of system memory. A
total of \emph{four} GPUs can be actively attached to any one user at any given
time.

Once that your job script is ready, you can submit it to the GPU queue
with:

\begin{verbatim}
qsub -q g.q ./<myscript>.sh
\end{verbatim}

And you can query \tool{nvidia-smi} on the node that is running your job with:

\begin{verbatim}
ssh <username>@speed[-05|-17] nvidia-smi
\end{verbatim}

Status of the GPU queue can be queried with:

\begin{verbatim}
qstat -f -u "*" -q g.q
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Very important note} regarding TensorFlow and PyTorch: 
if you are planning to run TensorFlow and/or PyTorch multi-GPU jobs, 
do not use the \api{tf.distribute} and/or \api{torch.nn.DataParallel} 
functions, as they will crash the compute node (100\% certainty). 
This appears to be the current hardware's architecture's defect.
%
The workaround is to either
% TODO: Need to link to that example
manually effect GPU parallelisation (TensorFlow has an example on how to
do this), or to run on a single GPU.

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent
\textbf{Important}
\vspace{10pt}

Users without permission to use the GPU nodes can submit jobs to the \texttt{g.q}
queue but those jobs will hang and never run.

% TODO: re-integrate this text to blend in and update the output
There are two GPUs in both \texttt{speed-05} and \texttt{speed-17}, and one 
in \texttt{speed-19}. Their availability is seen with, \texttt{qstat -F g}
(note the capital): 

\small
\begin{verbatim}
queuename                      qtype resv/used/tot. load_avg arch          states
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
g.q@speed-17.encs.concordia.ca BIP   0/0/32         0.01     lx-amd64

        hc:gpu=1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
etc. 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This status demonstrates that all five are available (i.e., have not been 
requested as resources). To specifically request a GPU node, add,
\texttt{-l g=[\#GPUs]}, to your \tool{qsub} (statement/script) or
\tool{qlogin} (statement) request. For example,
\texttt{qsub -l h\_vmem=1G -l g=1 ./count.sh}. You 
will see that this job has been assigned to one of the GPU nodes:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
queuename                      qtype resv/used/tot. load_avg arch          states
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
g.q@speed-05.encs.concordia.ca BIP 0/0/32 0.01 lx-amd64  hc:gpu=6 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
g.q@speed-17.encs.concordia.ca BIP 0/0/32 0.01 lx-amd64  hc:gpu=6 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
s.q@speed-19.encs.concordia.ca BIP 0/1/32 0.04 lx-amd64  hc:gpu=0 (haff=1.000000)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
etc. 
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

And that there are no more GPUs available on that node (\texttt{hc:gpu=0}). Note
that no more than two GPUs can be requested for any one job.

\section{Creating Virtual Environments}
\label{sect:environments}

The following documentation is specific to the \textbf{Speed} HPC Facility at the
 Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Anaconda}
To create an anaconda environment in your speed-scratch directory, use the \texttt{\-\-prefix} 
option when executing  \texttt{conda create}. For example, to create an anaconda environment for 
 \texttt{ai\_user}, execute the following at the command line:

\begin{verbatim}
conda create --prefix /speed-scratch/a_user/myconda
\end{verbatim}

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent
\textbf{Note:} Without the \texttt{\-\-prefix} option, the \texttt{conda create} command creates the 
environment in texttt{a\_user}'s home directory by default.
\vspace{10pt}

\subsubsection{List Environments}
To view your conda environments, type: \texttt{conda info --envs}

\begin{verbatim}
# conda environments:
#
base                  *  /encs/pkg/anaconda3-2019.07/root
                         /speed-scratch/a_user/myconda
\end{verbatim}      

\subsubsection{Activate an Environment}
Activate the environment \texttt{\/speed\-scratch\/a\_user\/myconda} as follows
\begin{verbatim}
conda activate /speed-scratch/a_user/myconda
\end{verbatim}
After activating your environment, add \tool{pip} to your environment by using 
\begin{verbatim}
conda install pip
\end{verbatim}
This will install \tool{pip} and \tool{pip}'s dependencies, including python, 
into the environment.

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent
\textbf{Important Note:} \tool{pip} (and \tool{pip3}) are used to install modules
 from the python distribution while \texttt{conda install} installs modules from 
 anaconda's repository.
\vspace{10pt}
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{CUDA}

When calling \tool{CUDA} within job scripts, it is important to create a link to
 the desired \tool{CUDA} libraries and set the runtime link path to the same libraries. 
For example, to use the \texttt{cuda-11.5} libraries, specify the following in 
your Makefile.
\begin{verbatim}
-L/encs/pkg/cuda-11.5/root/lib64 -Wl,-rpath,/encs/pkg/cuda-11.5/root/lib64
\end{verbatim}

In your job script, specify the version of \texttt{gcc} to use prior to calling 
cuda. For example: 
   \texttt{module load gcc/8.4}
or
   \texttt{module load gcc/9.3}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Special Notes for sending CUDA jobs to the GPU Queue}

It is not possible to create a \texttt{qlogin} session on to a node in the 
\textbf{GPU Queue} (\texttt{g.q}). As direct logins to these nodes is not 
available, jobs must be submitted to the \textbf{GPU Queue} in order to compile 
and link.

We have several versions of CUDA installed in:
\begin{verbatim}
/encs/pkg/cuda-11.5/root/
/encs/pkg/cuda-10.2/root/
/encs/pkg/cuda-9.2/root
\end{verbatim}

For CUDA to compile properly for the GPU queue, edit your Makefile 
replacing \option{\/usr\/local\/cuda} with one of the above.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{efficientdet}

The following steps describing how to create an efficientdet environment on \emph{Speed}
, were submitted by a member of Dr. Amer's Research Group.

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    Enter your ENCS user account's speed-scratch directory 
    \verb!cd /speed-scratch/<encs_username>!
    \item
    load python \verb!module load python/3.8.3!
    create virtual environment \verb!python3 -m venv <env_name>!
    activate virtual environment \verb!source <env_name>/bin/activate.csh!
    install DL packages for Efficientdet
\end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}
pip install tensorflow==2.7.0
pip install lxml>=4.6.1
pip install absl-py>=0.10.0
pip install matplotlib>=3.0.3
pip install numpy>=1.19.4

pip install git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI
\end{verbatim}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusion}
\label{sect:conclusion}

The cluster is, ``first come, first served'', until it fills, and then job
position in the queue is based upon past usage. The scheduler does attempt
to fill gaps, though, so sometimes a single-core job of lower priority
will schedule before a multi-core job of higher priority, for example.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Important Limitations}
\label{sect:limitations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
New users are restricted to a total of 32 cores: write to \url{rt-ex-hpc@encs.concordia.ca}
if you need more temporarily (256 is the maximum possible, or, 8 jobs of 32 cores each).

\item
Job sessions are a maximum of one week in length (only 24 hours, though,
for interactive jobs).

\item
Scripts can live in your NFS-provided home, but any substantial data need
to be in your cluster-specific directory
(located at \verb+/speed-scratch/<ENCSusername>/+).

NFS is great for acute activity, but is not ideal for chronic activity.
Any data that a job will 
read more than once should be copied at the start to the scratch disk of a 
compute node using \api{\$TMPDIR} (and, perhaps, \api{\$SGE\_O\_WORKDIR}), 
any intermediary job data should be produced in \api{\$TMPDIR}, and once a 
job is near to finishing, those data should be copied to your NFS-mounted 
home (or other NFS-mounted space) from \api{\$TMPDIR} (to, perhaps,
\api{\$SGE\_O\_WORKDIR}). In other words, IO-intensive operations should be effected 
locally whenever possible, saving network activity for the start and end of 
jobs. 

\item
Your current resource allocation is based upon past usage, which is an 
amalgamation of approximately one week's worth of past wallclock (i.e., time 
spent on the node(s)) and CPU activity (on the node(s)).

\item
Jobs should NEVER be run outside of the province of the scheduler. Repeat 
offenders risk loss of cluster access. 

\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Tips/Tricks}
\label{sect:tips}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Files/scripts must have Linux line breaks in them (not Windows ones).
\item
Use \tool{rsync}, not \tool{scp}, when moving data around. 
\item
If you are going to move many many files between NFS-mounted storage and the 
cluster, \tool{tar} everything up first. 
\item
If you intend to use a different shell (e.g., \tool{bash}~\cite{aosa-book-vol1-bash}),
you will need to source a different scheduler file, and will need to 
change the shell declaration in your script(s).
\item
The load displayed in \tool{qstat} by default is \api{np\_load}, which is
load/\#cores. That means that a load of, ``1'', which represents a fully active 
core, is displayed as $0.03$ on the node in question, as there are 32 cores 
on a node. To display load ``as is'' (such that a node with a fully active 
core displays a load of approximately $1.00$), add the following to your
\file{.tcshrc} file: \texttt{setenv SGE\_LOAD\_AVG load\_avg}

\item
Try to request resources that closely match what your job will use: 
requesting many more cores or much more memory than will be needed makes a 
job more difficult to schedule when resources are scarce.

\item
E-mail, \texttt{rt-ex-hpc AT encs.concordia.ca}, with any concerns/questions.

\section{History}

\subsection{Acknowledgments}
\label{sect:scott-acks}

The first 6 versions of this manual and early job script samples,
Singularity testing and user support were produced/done by Dr.~Scott Bunnell
during his time at Concordia as a part of the NAG/HPC group. We thank
him for his contributions.

\subsection{Phase 1}

Phase 1 of Speed was of the following configuration:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Sixteen, 32-core nodes, each with 512 GB of memory and approximately 1 TB of volatile-scratch disk space. 
\item
Five AMD FirePro S7150 GPUs, with 8 GB of memory (compatible with the Direct X, OpenGL, OpenCL, and Vulkan APIs). 
\end{itemize}

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Frequently Asked Questions}
\label{sect:faqs}

\subsection{"Disk quota exceeded" Error}
\subsubsection{Probably Cause}
The \texttt{"Disk quota exceeded"} Error occurs when your application has run out of disk space to write to. On Speed this error can be returned when:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
The \texttt{/tmp} directory on the speed node your application is running on is full and cannot be written to.
	\item
Your NFS-provided home is full and cannot be written to.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Possible Solutions}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
Use the \textbf{-cwd} job script option to make the directory that the job script
 is submitted from the \texttt{job working directory}, e.g., the directory to 
 store all output files in.
	\item
As previously mentioned in this manual, it is recommended to use local disk space 
for IO intensive operations, however, as the \texttt{/tmp} on the speed machines 
is \texttt{1GB} in size it may be necessary for scripts to store temporary data 
elsewhere. 
Review the documentation for the module(s) you are calling within your script to 
determine how to set working directories for that application. 
The basic steps for this solution are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
	Review the documentation for the module(s) you are calling within your script to 
	determine how to set working directories for that application.
	\item
	Create a directory in speed-scratch for your temporary files. 
	For example, to create a subdirector called \option{\/tmp} for user 
	\textbf{a\_user}, in that user's speed-scratch directory execute:
	\textbf{mkdir \-m 750 \/speed\-scratch\/a\_user\/tmp}
	\item
	If necessary, create a subdirectory for recovery files as well:
	\textbf{mkdir \-m 750 \/speed\-scratch\/a\_user\/recovery}
	\item
	Use the documentation to update your script(s) and command calls to use 
	the working directories created in the previous steps.	
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Example of setting working directories for \tool{COMSOL}}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	Create directories for recovery, temporary, and configuration files. 
	For example, to create these directories for \textbf{a\_user}:
	\begin{verbatim}
	mkdir -m 750 -p /speed-scratch/a_user/comsol/{recovery,tmp,config}
	\end{verbatim}
	\item
	Add the following command switches to the COMSOL command to use the 
	directories created for \textbf{a\_user} above:
	\begin{verbatim} 
	-recoverydir /speed-scratch/a_user/comsol/recovery 
	-tmpdir /speed-scratch/a_user/comsol/tmp
	-configuration/speed-scratch/a_user/comsol/config
	\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

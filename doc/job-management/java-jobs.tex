\subsection{Java Jobs}
\label{sect:java}

Jobs that call Java have a memory overhead, which needs to be taken
into account when assigning a value to \option{--mem}. Even the most basic
Java call, such as \texttt{Java -Xmx1G -version}, will need to have,
\texttt{--mem=5G}, with the 4 GB difference representing the memory overhead.
\textbf{Note} that this memory overhead grows proportionally with the value of
\texttt{-Xmx}. For example,

\begin{itemize}
  \item When \texttt{-Xmx} has a value of 100G, \option{--mem} has to be at least 106G.
  \item For \texttt{-Xmx} of 200G, \option{--mem} has to be at least 211G.
  \item For \texttt{-Xmx} of 300G, \option{--mem} has to be at least 314G.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{OpenCL}
\label{sect:cl}

We have a directory of jobs using OpenCL-based examples, that can
run on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, though examples, including a
benchmark, are current aimed mostly at AMG GPU in speed-19, they can
be adjusted to NVIDIA.

NOTE: OpenCL, originally to be an standard to CUDA,
is technically slower on NVIDIA devices unless manually tuned,
but some projects may still rely on it. Other compute alternatives
would include HIP to run CUDA code on AMD GPUs and Vulkan.

% TODO: add HIP and Vulkan jobs

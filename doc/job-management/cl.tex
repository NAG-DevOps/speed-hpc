\subsection{OpenCL}
\label{sect:cl}

We have a directory of jobs using OpenCL-based examples, that can
run on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, though examples, including a
benchmark, are current aimed at AMG GPU in speed-19, they can
be adjusted to NVIDIA.

NOTE: OpenCL, originally to be an open standard to CUDA,
is technically now deprecated, but some projects may still
rely on it. Newer alternatives would include HIP and Vulkan.
